% A Thorough Guide to Bond for C++

About
=====

Bond is an extensible framework for working with schematized data. It is
suitable for scenarios ranging from service communications to Big Data storage
and processing.

Bond defines a rich type system and [schema evolution rules](#schema-evolution)
which allow forward and backward compatibility. The core Bond features include
high performance serialization/deserialization and a very powerful, generic
data transform mechanism. The framework is highly extensible via pluggable
serialization protocols, data streams, user defined type aliases and more.

By design Bond is language and platform independent and is currently supported
for C++, C#, Java, and Python on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Bond is published on GitHub at
[https://github.com/microsoft/bond/](https://github.com/microsoft/bond).

Basic example
=============

In Bond data schemas are defined using idl-like [syntax](compiler.html#idl-syntax):

```
namespace example

struct Record
{
    0: string          name;
    1: vector<double>  items;
}
```

In order to use the schema in a C++ program, it needs to be compiled using the
Bond compiler [`gbc`](compiler.html). This step is sometimes also referred to as
code generation (or codegen) because the compilation generates C++ code
corresponding to the schema definition.

```
gbc c++ example.bond
```

Using the generated C++ code, we can write a simple program that will
serialize and deserialize an instance of the Record schema using [Compact
Binary](#compact-binary) protocol:

```cpp
#include "example_reflection.h"

#include <bond/core/bond.h>
#include <bond/stream/output_buffer.h>

int main()
{
    example::Record src;

    src.name = "test";
    src.items.push_back(3.14);

    bond::OutputBuffer output;
    bond::CompactBinaryWriter<bond::OutputBuffer> writer(output);

    Serialize(src, writer);

    bond::InputBuffer input(output.GetBuffer());
    bond::CompactBinaryReader<bond::InputBuffer> reader(input);

    example::Record dst;

    Deserialize(reader, dst);

    return 0;
}
```

Serialization
=============

The core feature provided by Bond is the ability to serialize and deserialize
instances of user-defined schemas. The serialization APIs are declared in the
`bond\core\bond.h` header file:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Writer>
void Serialize(const T& obj, Writer& output);

template <typename T, typename Reader>
void Deserialize(Reader input, T& obj);

template <typename T, typename Reader>
T Deserialize(Reader input);
```

The `Reader` and `Writer` template parameters specify the serialization
protocol, and are one of the layers at which Bond serialization can be
customized to meet applications' needs. The protocol defines how serialized
data is encoded (e.g. binary, text). Bond ships with several [built-in
protocols](#protocols) optimized for various scenarios, and also supports
user-defined [protocols](#custom-protocols). By convention, protocol
implementation is split between two classes implementing the reader, and the
writer:

```cpp
template <typename Buffer>
class CompactBinaryReader;

template <typename Buffer>
class CompactBinaryWriter;
```

The `Buffer` template parameter specifies where the serialized payload is
respectively read from and written to. This constitutes the second layer of
customization. Bond comes with built-in buffers implemented on top of memory
[blobs][blob_reference], `InputBuffer` and `OutputBuffer`, but applications
can also define custom buffers by [implementing simple stream
interfaces](#custom-streams).

The full protocol class names can be unwieldy and it is often convenient to
define shorter type aliases:

```cpp
typedef bond::InputBuffer Input;
typedef bond::CompactBinaryReader<Input> Reader;
typedef bond::OutputBuffer Output;
typedef bond::CompactBinaryWriter<Output> Writer;
```

which then can be used throughout application code:

```cpp
Output output;
Writer writer(output);
Serialize(obj1, writer);

Reader reader(output.GetBuffer());
Deserialize(reader, obj2);
```

In storage scenarios, when untagged protocols, such as the [Simple
Protocol](#simple-protocol), are used, applications need to specify the payload
schema during deserialization. The deserialization API has an overloaded
version to accommodate this usage:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Reader>
void Deserialize(Reader input, T& obj, const RuntimeSchema& schema);

template <typename T, typename Reader>
T Deserialize(Reader input, const RuntimeSchema& schema);
```

Typically the [runtime schema](#runtime-schema) is stored together with the
data, for example in a system table or a header of a data file. Since Bond may
need to access the runtime schema after the `Deserialize` function returns (to
support [lazy deserialization](#lazy-deserialization)), it is recommended that
applications manage lifetime of the schema object using smart pointers:

```cpp
boost::shared_ptr<bond::SchemaDef> schema(boost::make_shared<bond::SchemaDef>());

// Deserialize the runtime schema
bond::CompactBinaryReader<bond::InputBuffer> cb_reader(schema_data);
bond::Deserialize(cb_reader, *schema);

// Deserialize the object using the runtime schema
bond::SimpleBinaryReader<bond::InputBuffer> simple_reader(object_data);
Deserialize(simple_reader, obj, schema);
```

See examples:

- `examples/cpp/core/serialization`

Marshaling
==========

Since Bond supports multiple serialization [protocols](#protocols), application
endpoints either have to agree on a particular protocol, or include protocol
metadata in the payload. Marshaling APIs provide the standard way to do the
latter, by automatically adding a payload header with the protocol identifier
and version.

`Marshal` and `Unmarshal` APIs are very similar to `Serialize` and
`Deserialize`, except that when calling `Unmarshal` the application simply
provides an input stream with payload data, rather than an instance of a
particular protocol reader:

```cpp
bond::OutputBuffer output;
bond::CompactBinaryWriter<bond::OutputBuffer> writer(output);

Marshal(src, writer);

bond::InputBuffer input(output.GetBuffer());

Unmarshal(input, dst);
```

See example: `examples/cpp/core/marshaling`.

Schema evolution
================

Bond does not use explicit versioning to deal with changes to schemas (and the
resulting types) over time. Instead, Bond supports certain schema evolution
operations which allow the producer and consumer of Bond types to evolve
without lockstep coordination.

The following changes to a schema will never break compatibility across the wire:

- Adding or removing an `optional` or `required_optional` field
- Changing a field's type between `int32` and `enum`
- Changing a field's type between `vector<T>` and `list<T>`
- Changing a field's type between `blob` and `vector<int8>` or `blob` and
  `list<int8>`
- Changing a field's type between `T` and `bonded<T>`
- Adding new enumeration constants that don't alter existing constants (beware
  of implicit reordering)

The following changes to a type are generally safe but require some
consideration about how the change is rolled out:

- Changing a field between `optional` and `required_optional` or between
  `required_optional` and `required`. The `required_optional` modifier
  facilitates a two-step process for changing between `optional` and
  `required`, but the first step must be completed on both the producer and the
  consumer sides before the second step can be started on either side.
- Promoting a field with a numeric type from a smaller size to a larger size
  (e.g.: `float` to `double`, `uint8` to `uint16`, `uint8` to `uint32`, `int8`
  to `int16`, etc.). The consumer must get the change before the producer.
  Note that changing from unsigned to signed or vice versa is *not* compatible
  (e.g.: `uint8` to `int16`).
- Promoting from `int8` or `int16` to `enum`. The consumer must get the change
  before the producer.

These following changes will break wire compatibility and are not recommended:

- Adding or removing `required` fields
- Incompatible change of field types (any type change *not* covered above);
  e.g.: `int32` to `string`, `string` to `wstring`, `float` to
  `nullable<float>`
- Changing of field ordinals/ids
- Changing of inheritance hierarchy (add/remove/substituting base struct)
- Changing between `required` and `optional` directly
- Changing the default value of a field
- Changing existing enumeration constants in any way (including implicit
  renumbering)

Some best practices and other considerations to keep in mind:

- When removing a field, comment it out rather than removing it altogether
  so that neither the field ordinal nor name are reused in future edits of
  the schema
- When working with untagged protocols like
  [SimpleBinaryProtocol](#simple-binary), great care must be taken to ensure
  the same [schema](#runtime-schema) is used when deserializing the payload as
  was used to serialize it.
- Caution should be used when changing or reusing field names as this could
  break text-based protocols like [SimpleJsonProtocol](#simple-json)
- `required` should be used sparingly and only with careful consideration

Default values
==============

Fields of a Bond defined struct always have a default value, either
explicitly specified in the .bond file, or the implicit default.

The implicit default is

* `false` for `bool` fields
* 0 for arithmetic types
* empty for string/containers
* `null` for [nullable type](#nullable-types)
* for struct and `bonded` fields, an instance of a struct in which all of
  the fields are initialized to their default values, recursively

There is no implicit default for enum fields: they must have an explicit
default value in the .bond file.

Explicit default values (other than [`nothing`](#default-value-of-nothing))
may not be specified for `nullable` or container fields. Struct and `bonded`
fields may not have an explicit default value. They always use their
implicit default values.

The default values of fields matter because this is what an application will
see after deserialization for any optional field that wasn't present in the
payload (e.g. when the payload was created from an older version of the
schema).

Additionally, some protocols can omit
[`optional` non-struct fields](#required-fields) set to their default
values, reducing payload size.

Default value of `nothing`
==========================

Sometimes it is necessary to distinguish between any of the possible values
of a field and absence of a value. To support such scenarios Bond allows
non-struct fields' default values to be explicitly set to `nothing` [^1]:

```
struct AboutNothing
{
    0: uint16 n = nothing;
    1: string name = nothing;
    2: list<float> floats = nothing;
}
```

Setting a field's default to `nothing` doesn't affect the schema type of the
field, however it may affect what type the field is mapped to in the
generated code. The reason why is pretty obvious: some types such as
`uint16_t` just can't represent absence of a value. In C++ fields with
default of `nothing` always map to [`bond::maybe<T>`][maybe_reference].

The fact that setting the default value of a field to `nothing` doesn't
affect the field's schema type has an important consequence: the default
value of the field doesn't have a serialized representation. What this means
in practice depends on whether the field is `optional` or `required`.
Optional fields set to `nothing` are usually omitted during serialization
[^2], just like for any other default values.
[Required fields](#required-fields), by definition, can never be omitted.
Since `nothing` has no serialized representation, an attempt to serialize an
object with required fields set to `nothing` will result in a runtime
exception. If a `null` value needs to be represented in the serialized form,
then a default of `nothing` is the wrong choice and a
[nullable type](#nullable-types) should be used instead.


[^1]: In Bond there is no concept of a default value for structs and thus a
default of `nothing` can't be set for fields of struct types or `bonded<T>`.

[^2]: Some protocols might not support omitting optional fields (e.g. Simple
Protocol) or omitting fields may be disabled by specializing the
`bond::may_omit_fields` trait. In such cases an attempt to serialize an
object with field(s) set to `nothing` will result in a runtime exception.


Nullable types
==============

For any type in the Bond meta-schema, `nullable<T>` defines a nullable type.
A nullable type can store all the same values as its base type plus one
additional value: `null`.

```
struct Nullables
{
    0: nullable<bool>         b; // can be true, false, or null
    1: list<nullable<string>> l; // can be a (possibly empty) list or null
}
```

The default value for a field of a nullable type is always implicitly set to
`null`. Explicit default values for nullable fields are not supported.

In the generated C++ code nullable types are represented by the
[`nullable<T>`][nullable_reference] class template.

Since a nullable type must represent the additional value of `null`, its
serialized representation necessarily incurs some overhead compared to the
base type. Often it is more efficient to avoid using a nullable type and
instead to designate one of the normal values to handle the special case
that otherwise would be represented by `null`. For example _empty_ is
usually a good choice for string and container types and 0 for arithmetic
types. Another option that may sometimes be appropriate is setting the
default value of a non-struct field to
[`nothing`](#default-value-of-nothing). Struct fields can have neither an
explicit default value nor be set to `nothing`, so `nullable` needs to be
used if `null` semantics are needed for these fields.

The canonical scenario where a nullable type is the right choice is
recursive structures. For example here's how Bond `TypeDef` struct is
defined:

```
struct TypeDef
{
    // Type identifier
    0: BondDataType id = BT_STRUCT;

    // Index of struct definition in SchemaDef.structs when id == BT_STRUCT
    1: uint16 struct_def = 0;

    // Type definition for:
    //  list elements (id == BT_LIST),
    //  set elements (id == BT_SET),
    //  or mapped value (id == BT_MAP)
    2: nullable<TypeDef> element;

    // Type definition for map key when id == BT_MAP
    3: nullable<TypeDef> key;

    // True if the type is bonded<T>; used only when id == BT_STRUCT
    4: bool bonded_type;
}
```

The `TypeDef` struct is used to represent the type of a field in a Bond
schema. If the type is a container such as a list or map, the type
definition becomes recursive. For example, a list type definition contains
the type of the list element which of course itself can be a container of
elements of some other type, and so on, until the recursion is terminated
with a `null` value for the `element` and `key` fields.

Runtime schema
==============

Some generic applications may need to work with Bond schemas unknown at
compile-time. In order to address such scenarios Bond defines a type
`SchemaDef` to represent schemas at runtime. Applications can obtain an
instance of `SchemaDef` for a particular type using the `GetRuntimeSchema` API:

```cpp
// from type T
auto schema = bond::GetRuntimeSchema<Example>();

// from an instance
auto schema = bond::GetRuntimeSchema(obj);
```

The value returned by `GetRuntimeSchema` is of type `bond::RuntimeSchema`,
which is a thin wrapper over `SchemaDef`. The runtime schema object returned by
the API is always self contained, including the runtime schema definitions for
all nested types (if any). Note that GetRuntimeSchema returns a static object
and can't be called during module initialization (e.g. from a constructor of
a static object).

`SchemaDef` is a Bond type, defined in `bond.bond`, and as such can be
de/serialized like any other Bond type:

```cpp
Serialize(bond::GetRuntimeSchema<Example>(), writer);
```

A runtime schema is often used to describe the schema of a serialized payload,
in particular when using an untagged [protocol](#protocols):

```cpp
bond::SimpleBinaryReader reader(dataPayload);
auto schema = boost::make_shared<bond::SchemaDef>();

Unmarshal(schemaPayload, *schema);
Deserialize(reader, obj, schema);
```

The Deserialize API in the above code snippet is a thin wrapper around the
generic way to describe payload with a runtime schema: `bonded<void>`:

```cpp
bond::bonded<void> data(reader, schema);
```

A `bonded<void>` object can be used like any
[`bonded<T>`](#understanding-bondedt), e.g. it can be serialized/transcoded:

```cpp
Serialize(data, writer);
```

When an application creates an instance of `SchemaDef` in order to use it with
Bond APIs, it is strongly recommended to always dynamically allocate the object
and wrap it in a `boost::shared_ptr`, like in the example above. There are some
subtle cases when Bond may need to keep a reference to the schema beyond the
scope where it was created, and using a `shared_ptr` provides a safe and
efficient way to achieve this. In order to encourage this, the
`bond::RuntimeSchema` wrapper used by many Bond APIs is implicitly
constructable from `boost::shared_ptr<SchemaDef>` but only explicitly from
`const SchemaDef&`.

A serialized representation of `SchemaDef` can be also obtained directly from
a schema definition IDL file using [bond compiler](compiler.html#runtime-schema).

See example: `examples/cpp/core/runtime_schema`.

Compile-time schema
===================

Bond generated C++ classes define a nested struct called `Schema` which
describes the type's schema. It is called compile-time schema because it
supports reflection on the schema during C++ compilation, enabling various
meta-programming techniques. The struct `Schema` has the following members:

- `base`

    A typedef which is defined to either `bond::no_base` or the compile-time
    schema of the base schema.

- `metadata`

    A static data member of type `bond::Metadata` (defined in `bond::bond`).
    Describes schema's metadata, such a name and optional attributes.

- `var`

    A struct with a typedef member for each schema field. The typedefs have the
    same name as the fields, e.g. `Example::Schema::var::m_example` represents
    a field `m_example` of class `Example`. The typedefs are defined to
    instances of [`bond::reflection::FieldTemplate`][field_template_reference]
    template.

- `fields`

    A `boost::mpl::list` of the fields. The elements of the list are typedef
    memebers of the `var` struct described above.

Compile-time schema can also be defined in a non-intrusive way, e.g. for
classes that can't be modified, by specializing `schema` meta-function:

    template <typename T, typename Enable = void> struct
    schema;

For an example see the compile-time schema definition for `std::tuple<T...>` in
`bond/core/tuple.h`.

Code examples:

- `examples/cpp/core/compile_time_schema`
- `examples/cpp/core/polymorphic_container_visitor`

Understanding `bonded<T>`
=========================

The generic type `bonded<T>` is a simple yet powerful abstraction which is a
fundamental part of Bond APIs and enables such usage scenarios as lazy
deserialization, protocol transcoding, pass-through and polymorphism.

Fundamentally, `bonded<T>` is used to represents a struct data, but it is much
more versatile than a simple struct instance. Before we explore its
capabilities, let's first look at C++ declaration of [`bonded`
class][bonded_reference]:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Reader = ProtocolReader<T, InputBuffer>>
class bonded;
```

The class template has two parameters. The first one, `T`, represents schema
(or type) of the data. Usually it is a struct defined via Bond
[IDL](compiler.html#idl-syntax) but it can also be `void` (see
[`bonded<void>`][bonded_void_reference]) if we want to work with data for which
schema is not known at compile-time. The second parameter, `Reader`, specifies
representation of the data. The default, `ProtocolReader` is a variant type
which can hold data serialized using any of the Bond protocols, or an instance
of struct `T`.

The `bonded` class defines several constructors which allow creation of
`bonded` objects from following inputs:

- Instance of `T` or a type derived from `T` [^slicing]

<!-- -->
```cpp
using bond::bonded;

MyStruct obj;

// Copy obj by value
bonded<MyStruct> b1(obj);

// Store reference to obj
bonded<MyStruct> b2(boost::ref(obj));

// Store shared_ptr to object
auto ptr = boost::make_shared<MyStruct>();
bonded<MyStruct> b3(ptr);
```

- Serialized payload

<!-- -->
```cpp
bond::CompactBinaryReader<bond::InputBuffer> reader(payload);

bonded<MyStruct> b4(reader);

bonded<void> b5(reader, schema);
```

- Compatible instance of `bonded`

<!-- -->
```cpp
// Implicit up-casting
bonded<MyStructBase> b6(b4);

// Explicit down-casting
bonded<MyStruct> b7(b6);

// Explicit cast to bonded<void>
bonded<void> b8(b7);

// Explicit cast from bonded<void>
bonded<MyStruct> b9(b8);
```

APIs associated with `bonded<T>` are very simple. Given an instance of
`bonded<T>` we can essentially perform two operations on the contained data:

- Deserialize an object from the data
- Serialize the data using a protocol writer

Versatility of `bonded<T>` comes from how these two operations apply to various
kinds of data.

[^slicing]: An object of a derived type will be sliced to the type `T`.

Lazy deserialization
--------------------

Because `bonded<T>` can store (or more accurately, refer to) data representing
a serialized struct, it can be used to de facto delay deserialization of some
parts of payload:

```
struct Example
{
    0: Always            m_always;
    1: bonded<Sometimes> m_sometimes;
}
```

The schema defined above contains two nested fields. When an object of type
`Example` is deserialized, the field `m_always` will be fully instantiated and
deserialized, but field `m_sometimes`, which is declared as
`bonded<Sometimes>`, will be merely initialized with a reference to its
serialized representation [^bonded_cost].

```cpp
Example example;

Deserialize(reader, example);

// Deserialize m_sometimes only when needed
if (needSometimes)
{
    Sometimes sometimes;

    example.m_sometimes.Deserialize(sometimes);
}
```

[^bonded_cost]: Cost of deserializing `bonded<T>` is protocol dependent. Most
protocols need to parse the payload in order to find where the corresponding
struct ends. Compact Binary version 2 stores length prefix for structs and thus
can deserialize a `bonded<T>` field in constant time.

Protocol transcoding
--------------------

If `bonded<T>` contains data representing a serialized struct, what does it
mean to serialize it? The answer to this questions is the key to understanding
the power and versatility of `bonded<T>`. When serializing a `bonded<T>`
object, Bond will iterate through the serialized data, decode each field and
write it to target protocol writer
[^same_protocol_opt]. What's more, if the source data is encoded using a tagged
protocol (e.g. Compact Binary) Bond doesn't depend on definition of struct `T`
to know what fields the payload contains. The payload is self-described and
Bond is able to preserve all fields, even those that are not part of struct `T`
(e.g. because the payload was created using a newer version of the schema). In
fact `bonded<T>` can be serialized *even* if definition of type `T` is not
known!

```cpp
// Declare Unknown; actual definition is not needed
struct Unknown;

// Transcode data from Compact Binary to JSON
bond::CompactBinary<bond::InputBuffer> reader(data);
bond::bonded<Unknown> payload(reader);

bond::OutputBuffer json;
bond::SimpleJsonWriter<bond::OutputBuffer> writer(json);

Serialize(payload, writer);
```

The sample code above would preserve all the fields from the source data,
however it would not preserve the field names, producing JSON output looking
something like this:

```javascript
{
    "10": "Sample Konfabulator Widget",
    "30": 500,
    "40": 500
}
```

The output is sufficient to deserialize the object using Bond, but it is not
particularly human-readable. If we wanted to preserve fields names in JSON
output, we would need to specify the payload schema, by using either `bonded`
of a defined Bond struct rather than `Unknown`, or `bonded<void>` with a schema
provided at runtime.

```cpp
// Transcode data from Compact Binary to JSON using runtime schema
bond::CompactBinary<bond::InputBuffer> reader(data);
bond::bonded<void> payload(reader, schema);

bond::OutputBuffer json;
bond::SimpleJsonWriter<bond::OutputBuffer> writer(json);

Serialize(payload, writer);
```

The `schema` object in the example above is an instance of
[`bond::SchemaDef`](#runtime-schema). With full schema information transcoded
JSON output will be more human-friendly:

```javascript
{
    "title": "Sample Konfabulator Widget",
    "width": 500,
    "height": 500
}
```

See also: `examples/cpp/core/protocol_transcoding`

[^same_protocol_opt]: As an optimization, if the data is already encoded in the
target protocol Bond will simply copy the payload.

Pass-through
------------

The fact that `bonded<T>` preserves unknown fields is very useful when building
service pipelines. Intermediary nodes often need to pass data through with full
fidelity. At the same time, it is desirable that every schema change doesn't
necessitate redeployment of all the nodes in a pipeline. Using `bonded<T>` for
pass-through is often the right solution.

As an example let's imagine a simple aggregator which receives responses from
upstream services and aggregates top results.

```
struct Response;

struct Upstream
{
    0: bonded<Response> response;
    1: float ranking;
}

struct Aggregated
{
    0: list<bonded<Response>> responses;
}
```

Using `bonded<Response>` allows the intermediary to aggregate responses,
preserving their full content, even though schema of `Response` is not known
when the aggregator is built, and thus it doesn't need to be rebuilt or
redeployed when schema of `Response` changes.

```cpp
void ProcessResponse(const Upstream& upstream)
{
    if (upstream.ranking > threshold)
    {
        m_aggregated.responses.push_back(upstream.response);
    }
}
```

Polymorphism
------------

Bond support for polymorphism is built around the capability of `bonded<T>` to
contain serialized struct data not limited to just fields of struct `T`. In
particular `bonded<Base>` can contain serialized data for some struct `Derived`
which inherits from `Base`. Together with the ability to down-cast
`bonded<Base>` to `bonded<Dervied>`, this enables use of Bond schemas
supporting serialization of polymorphic objects.

```
enum Kind
{
    rectangle,
    circle,
    none
}

struct Shape
{
    0: Kind kind = none;
}

struct Rectangle: Shape
{
    0: int32 width;
    1: int32 height;
}

struct Circle : Shape
{
    0: int32 radius;
}

struct Example
{
    0: list<bonded<Shape>> shapes;
}
```

- `examples/cpp/core/polymorphic_container_visitor`

Bonus explainer: parallels between `bonded<T>` and C++ pointers
---------------------------------------------------------------

The rules of casting and slicing that apply to `bonded<T>` are by design very
similar to the standard C++ rules for pointers:

+---------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                           | bonded\<T\>                     | C++ pointer                       |
+===========================+=================================+===================================+

Merge
=====

An important feature of Bond is the ability to preserve unknown fields
([Pass-through](#pass-through)), or even whole parts of the inheritance
hierarchy ([Polymorphism](#polymorphism)), when transcoding or forwarding
serialized Bond payloads. The merge feature builds on these capabilities by
allowing modifications to the known part of a structure and merging them with
any unknown parts present in the payload.

The `Merge` API takes as input an instance of a Bond object and a serialized
payload and writes the merged result to the specified protocol writer:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Reader, typename Writer>
void Merge(const T& obj, Reader input, Writer& output);
```

The `Reader` and `Writer` can be for different protocols (in other words
merging can transcode payload at the same time). The type `T` of the object is
usually somehow related to the schema of the input payload (e.g. a different
version of the schema or its base). In the typical usage scenario, the object
is first deserialized from the payload, and then modified and merged with
original payload.

The `Merge` API is a thin wrapper around the `Merger` transform which can be
applied to a [`bonded<T>`](#understanding-bondedt) in order to merge its
payload with an instance of T, e.g.:

```cpp
typedef bond::CompactBinaryWriter<bond::OutputBuffer> Writer;
T obj;
bond::bonded<T> payload;
// ...
Writer output(buffer);
Apply(bond::Merger<T, Writer>(obj, output), payload);
```

For fields that are present in the object's schema, the value in the object is
serialized, otherwise the value for the unknown field in the payload is
preserved. Merge works recursively, merging bases and any nested structures,
including structures that are elements of a container. When merging containers
containing structures, lists and vectors must have the same number of elements
and maps must have the same set of keys in both the object and in the payload,
otherwise Merge throws an exception. Containers with non-struct types as
elements are treated like regular fields.

Fields and containers of type `bonded<T>` are not merged and instead the value
from the object is written to the output. This allows applications to
selectively merge individual `bonded<T>` fields or elements, enabling, for
example, merging of containers when elements have been added or removed.

The helper method Merge supports the common scenario where the result of merge
is put back as payload of `bonded<T>`:

```cpp
template <typename T>
template <typename X>
void bonded<T>::Merge(const X& var);
```

See example: `examples/cpp/core/merge`.


Required fields
===============

By default, fields of a struct in Bond schemas are considered optional. This
means that during deserialization, if the payload doesn't contain a field,
Bond will just use the field's [default value](#default-values) specified in
the schema. Consequently, during serialization optional fields which are set
to their default value _can_ be omitted, resulting in a more compact
payload. This behavior is fundamental to enabling forward and backward
compatibility between [different schema versions](#schema-evolution). As
long as fields are optional, they can be freely added and removed, without
breaking the ability of the old code to deserialize the new data and vice
versa. In distributed systems, where we usually can't depend on deployment
order, this two-way compatibility is a critical feature. This is why
optional fields are the implicit default in Bond, and why avoiding required
fields is generally considered a good rule of thumb.

Required fields can be declared using the following syntax.

```
struct Example
{
    0: required int32 field;
}
```

Required fields _must_ be present in the payload during deserialization
(otherwise an exception is thrown) and consequently they are always written to
the payload during serialization.

When should you use required fields? One way to think about this is that
required fields are a way to _explicitly break_ schema compatibility.
Essentially, a schema with required field(s) means: a consumer using this
schema is incompatible with any version of the schema, past or future, that
doesn't have the required field(s). In cases when the semantics of a field are
such that the schema doesn't make sense without it, declaring the field as
required might be the right thing to do.

Specifying a field as required doesn't mean that it can _never_ be removed from
the schema, but it does mean that _all_ existing consumers using the schema
will have to be updated first. In order to enable adding/removing required
fields (or converting optional fields to required and vice versa), Bond
supports an intermediary state for fields called `required_optional`. Fields
that are marked as `required_optional` behave like required fields during
serialization (i.e. their value is always included in the payload) and like
optional fields during deserialization (i.e. if the field is not in the
payload, Bond will use the default value). This allows non-breaking,
deployment-order-independent schema changes that involve `required` fields.

**required <----> required_optional <----> optional**

Changes involving `required` fields take two steps. First the schema is updated
to use a `required_optional` field (i.e. a new `required_optional` field is
added or an existing `required` or `optional` field is converted to
`required_optional`). These changes are non-breaking and can be deployed in any
order. Once all programs using the updated schema are deployed, in the second
step the `required_optional` field can be removed or converted to `required` or
`optional` as desired. Again these changes are non-breaking.

Tuples
======

Bond can de/serialize instances of std::tuple<T...> as if they were regular
Bond-defined structs. For example the following tuple instance:

```cpp
std::tuple<std::string, double, std::vector<uint32_t>>
```

is equivalent to this Bond schema:

```
struct tuple
{
    0: string item0;
    1: double item1;
    2: vector<uint32> item2;
}
```

Field ordinals used for Bond serialization are the same as tuple item
identifiers used with std::get<N> function. Field names are `item`*N* where is
*N* is the item identifier. The schema/struct name for a tuple instance is
`tuple<`*parameters*`>`.

Since field ordinals are implicitly assigned based on the order in which items
are defined, tuples don't offer the same versioning flexibility as explicitly
defined Bond schemas. In particular, adding or removing any tuple item other
than the last is a breaking change because it offsets ordinals of all
subsequent items.

Tuple instances can be used with all Bond APIs that accept regular Bond defined
structs, e.g:

```cpp
auto obj = std::tuple<string, double>;

Serialize(obj, writer);
Deserialize(reader, obj);
auto schema = bond::GetRuntimeSchema(obj);
```

Bond provides helper functions `Pack` and `Unpack` which can be used
respectively to create/serialize a tuple from several values and deserialize
fields into several variables.

```cpp
std::string str;
Pack(writer, str, 10);

int n;
std::string str2;
Unpack(reader, str2, n);
```

If the payload contains more fields than variables provided to `Unpack` the
tail fields are ignored. The special object `std::ignore` can be passed as an
argument to `Pack` and `Unpack` in order to ignore field(s) at particular
position(s). For example:

```cpp
Pack(writer, std::ignore, 10);
```

will serialize a struct/tuple containing one field with ordinal 1 and type
`int`. Similarly:

```cpp
Unpack(reader, std::ignore, n);
```

will ignore the field with ordinal 0, if any, and deserialize the field with
ordinal 1 into the variable `n`.

Examples:

- `examples/native/core/trace`
- `examples/native/core/variadic`

Transforms
==========

Bond transform are a powerful mechanism which enables writing generic,
schema-independent, type-safe and high performance code operating on instances
of Bond generated classes and their serialized representation. As transforms
are flexible and have good performance characteristics, the core APIs like
`Serialize` and `Deserialize` are in fact implemented as applications of
transforms.

```cpp
// Serialize and Deserialize APIs as defined in bond.h

template <typename T, typename Writer>
inline void Serialize(const T& obj, Writer& output)
{
    Apply(Serializer<Writer>(output), obj);
}

template <typename T, typename Reader>
inline void Deserialize(Reader input, T& obj)
{
    Apply(To<T>(obj), bonded<T, Reader&>(input));
}
```

Transforms are an instance of the visitor pattern. A transform class implements
methods which are called by a Bond parser for the fields of a Bond type
instance or its serialized representation. The name _transform_ comes from the
fact that they usually perform transformation of Bond objects or payloads. For
example the `Serializer` transform can be applied to an object and output its
serialized representation, or it may be applied to a payload encoded in one
protocol and transcode it into another protocol.

Transforms are applied using the `bond::Apply` API. The first argument to
`Apply` is always a const reference to an instance of transform class, and the
second argument is an object the transform should be applied to. There are
essentially three overloads of `Apply` API [^apply_overloads]:

```cpp
template <typename Transform, typename T, typename Reader>
bool Apply(const Transform& transform, const bonded<T, Reader>& bonded);

template <typename Transform, typename T, typename Reader>
void Apply(const Transform& transform, const value<T, Reader>& value);

template <typename Transform, typename T>
bool Apply(const Transform& transform, T& value);
```

[^apply_overloads]: Reviewing `apply.h` will reveal that in fact there are a
few more overloads of `Apply`, and their signatures are more complex. However
these can be considered implementation details, only defined to enable the
compiler to select of the proper implementation in various scenarios.
Conceptually, the `Apply` API can be called to apply a transform to one of
three _things_: `bonded<T>`, `value<T>` or an instance of a Bond class.

A transform class must inherit from one of the following classes:

- [`bond::SerializingTransform`][serializing_transform_ref]
- [`bond::DeserializingTransform`][deserializing_transform_ref]
- [`bond::ModifyingTransform`][modifying_transform_ref]

The base indicates the type of transformation performed by the class, and what
kind of object it can be applied to. A serializing transform can be applied to
an object or a serialized payload and usually outputs serialized payload. A
deserializing transform can only be applied to a serialized payload. A
modifying transform can only be applied to a non-const object and usually
modifies the object.

Transform concept
-----------------

A transform class has to implement the following concept:

```cpp
struct Transform
{
    // All transforms
    void Begin(const bond::Metadata& metadata) const;

    void End() const;

    template <typename T>
    bool Base(const T& value) const;

    template <typename T>
    bool Field(uint16_t id, const bond::Metadata& metadata, T& value) const;

    // Only serializing and deserializing transforms
    void UnknownEnd() const;

    template <typename T>
    bool UnknownField(uint16_t id, T& value) const;

    bool OmittedField(uint16_t id, const bond::Metadata& metadata, bond::BondDataType type) const;

    // Only serializing transforms
    template <typename T>
    void Container(const T& element, uint32_t size) const;

    template <typename Key, typename T>
    void Container(const Key& key, const T& value, uint32_t size) const;
};
```

The type `T` of the values visited by a transform depends on what the transform
is applied to. If it is applied to an instance of a Bond type, the visited
values will be references to the object's fields and/or its base object (if
any). If a transform is applied to a serialized payload, the visited values
will represent the serialized fields, elements of a container and/or base (if
any). The serialized data is represented by one of two types: `bond::bonded<T,
Reader>` or `bond::value<T, Reader>`. The former represents a serialized Bond
object and the latter a serialized value of a basic type or a container.

A transform can generally do one of two things with the serialized values:

1. Deserialize using the Deserialize method

<!-- -->
```cpp
template <typename T, typename Reader>
typename boost::enable_if<bond::is_basic_type<T>>::type
Field(uint16_t, const bond::Metadata&, const bond::value<T, Reader>& value) const
{
    T x;
    value.Deserialize(x);
    return false;
}
```

2. Recursively apply the transform

<!-- -->
```cpp
template <typename T>
bool Base(const T& value) const
{
    return Apply(MyTransform(), value);
}
```

Recursive application of transforms is a key technique which enables
transformations of arbitrary complex/nested schemas/containers. By creating and
applying an new instance of its class, a transform class can easily implement
management of per-hierarchy-level state. For example a transform creating a
text output such as XML, could store the indentation level in its data member
and create a new instance with increased indentation to be applied to nested
fields.

Transforms are a deep topic and by necessity this article only touches on the
most basic concepts. Users writing their own custom transforms are encouraged
to study the implementation of built in transforms in
[transfroms.h][transforms_h], in particular the `Serializer<Writer>` and
`To<T>` transforms.

- `examples/cpp/core/modifying_transform`

Reflection
==========

See [compile-time schema](#compile-time-schema) and [transforms](#transforms).

Protocols
=========

Bond protocols are pluggable, allowing application to choose the most
appropriate encoding format. Bond supports three kinds of protocols:

  - Tagged protocols

    Tagged protocols interleave schema metadata within the payload. This makes
    the payload self-describing, allowing consumers to interpret it even
    without knowing the schema used by the producer.

  - Untagged protocols

    Untagged protocols serialize only data and thus require that consumers know
    the payload schema via some out-of-band mechanism. Untagged protocols are
    often used in storage scenarios because they allow storing a
    [schema](#runtime-schema) once (e.g. in a system table in a database) and
    thus eliminating metadata overhead from many records using the same schema.

  - DOM-based protocols

    DOM-based protocol parse whole payload into an in-memory Data Object Model
    which then is queried during deserialization. Typically this kind of
    protocol is used to implement text based encoding such as JSON or XML.

Compact Binary
--------------

A binary, tagged protocol using variable integer encoding and compact field
header. A good choice, along with [Fast Binary](#fast-binary), for RPC
scenarios.

Implemented in [`CompactBinaryReader`][compact_binary_reader_reference] and
[`CompactBinaryWriter`][compact_binary_writer_reference] classes.

Version 2 of Compact Binary adds length prefix for structs. This enables
deserialization of [`bonded<T>`](#understanding-bondedt) and skipping of
unknown fields in constant time. The trade-off is double pass encoding,
resulting in up to 30% slower serialization performance. You can enable Compact
Binary version 2 by instantiating the
[`CompactBinaryReader`][compact_binary_reader_reference] and
[`CompactBinaryWriter`][compact_binary_writer_reference] classes with their
second optional constructor argument (`version`) set to the integer 2.

See also [Compact Binary encoding reference][compact_binary_format_reference].

Fast Binary
-----------

A binary, tagged protocol similar to [Compact Binary](#compact-binary) but
optimized for deserialization speed rather than payload compactness.

Implemented in [`FastBinaryReader`][fast_binary_reader_reference] and
[`FastBinaryWriter`][fast_binary_writer_reference] classes.

See also [Fast Binary encoding reference][fast_binary_format_reference].

Simple Binary
-------------

A binary, untagged protocol which is a good choice for storage scenarios as it
offers potential for big saving on payload size. Because Simple is an untagged
protocol, it requires that the payload schema is available during
deserialization. In typical storage scenario application would store [runtime
schema](#runtime-schema) and use it during deserialization with
[`bonded<void>`][bonded_void_reference]. In some specific scenarios when it can
be assumed that producer and consumer have exactly the same schema, Simple
Protocol can be used with compile-time schema, providing unparalleled
deserialization performance. One example is marshaling objects between
processes or between native and managed components.

Implemented in [`SimpleBinaryReader`][simple_binary_reader_reference] and
[`SimpleBinaryWriter`][simple_binary_writer_reference] classes.

Version 2 of Simple Protocol uses variable integer encoding for string and
container lengths, resulting in more compact payload without measurable
performance impact.

See example: `examples/cpp/core/protocol_versions`.

Simple JSON
-----------

The Simple JSON protocol is a simple JSON encoding implemented as a DOM
protocol. The output is standard JSON and is a very good choice for
interoperating with other systems or generating human readable payload.

Because the payload doesn't include field ordinals, there are two caveats
when used as a Bond serialization protocol:

- Transcoding from Simple JSON to binary Bond protocols is not supported
  (transcoding from a binary protocol to Simple JSON is supported if you
  have the schema).
- Field matching is done by field name rather than ordinal. The implication
  is that renaming a field (which is considered a bad practice anyways) is a
  breaking schema change for Simple JSON.

Simple JSON also flattens the inheritance hierarchy which may lead to name
conflicts between fields of base and derived Bond structs. It is possible to
resolve such conflicts without the need to actually rename the fields by
annotating fields with `JsonName` attribute, e.g.:

```
struct Base
{
    0: string foo;
}

struct Derived : Base
{
    [JsonName("DerivedFoo")]
    0: string foo;
}
```

Note that Simple JSON is not designed to be able to read arbitrary JSON
objects. Simple JSON has its own way of encoding Bond objects in JSON that
differs from how other libraries would encode the same object. When
interoperating with other JSON libraries, be aware of these differences:

- maps are encoded as arrays of key/value pairs not as sub-objects
- the inheritance hierarchy is flattened
- nulls are expressed as empty arrays
- enums are encoded via their numeric value, not their symbolic names

Implemented in [`SimpleJsonReader`][simple_json_reader_reference] and
[`SimpleJsonWriter`][simple_json_writer_reference] classes.

See examples:

- `examples/cpp/core/simple_json`


Custom type mappings
====================

Bond codegen provides a simple extensibility mechanism allowing use of custom
C++ types to represent types in a Bond schema. One common scenario is replacing
the default STL containers with a different implementation that is semantically
identical, e.g. `std::unordered_map` instead of `std::map`. Custom type
mappings can be also used to introduce completely new types which can be
serialized to one of the built-in Bond schema types. For example time could be
represented using the `boost::posix_time::ptime` class and serialized as
`int64`.

Defining a custom type mapping involves three steps:

- Define a [type alias](compiler.html#type-aliases) in the schema.
- Specify during codegen a C++ type to represent the alias.
- Implement an appropriate concept for the custom C++ type.

Codegen parameters
------------------

When generating code for a schema that uses [type aliases](compiler.html#type-aliases), the
user can specify a custom type to represent each alias in the generated code:

```
gbc c++ --using="time=boost::posix_time::ptime" time.bond
```

The value of the `--using` parameter is a custom alias mapping in the following
format:

```
alias-name=generated-type-name
```

Generated code using custom types usually has to include a header file with
appropriate declarations. The `gbc` compiler supports the `--header` parameter
for that purpose:

```
gbc c++ --header="<time_alias.h>" --using="time=boost::posix_time::ptime" time.bond
```

The above command will add the following statement at the top of the generated
header file `time_types.h`:

```cpp
#include <time_alias.h>
```

Additionally `--type-aliases` flag can be used to generate corresponding C++
[type aliases](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias) in `time_types.h`.

Container concept
-----------------

The custom container concept defined in `bond/core/container_interface.h`
serves as an interface between a custom container type and Bond. The concept
consists of compile-time meta-function (traits) that need to be specialized for
the custom container type and overloaded free functions which implement the
runtime interaction with the container instances. The concept forms
a non-intrusive interface, which can be provided for any type without changes
to its implementation.

The first step is to identify a type as an appropriate container by
specializing one of the following traits:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct
is_set_container
    : std::false_type {};

template <typename T> struct
is_map_container
    : std::false_type {};

template <typename T> struct
is_list_container
    : std::false_type {};
```

For example the following specialization would allow Bond to treat `std::array`
as a list type:

```cpp
template <typename T, std::size_t N> struct
is_list_container<std::array<T, N> >
    : std::true_type {};
```

The second trait called `element_type` specifies the type of the container
elements:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct
element_type
{
    typedef typename T::value_type type;
};
```

The default implementation assumes a commonly used STL convention of using
a nested `value_type` typedef and will likely work for many container
implementations from libraries like Boost. For other containers the trait can
specialized, e.g.:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct
element_type<MyList<T> >
{
    typedef T type;
};
```

The next part of the container concept consists of free functions exposing
container size and operations to add and remove elements.

```cpp
template <typename T>
uint32_t container_size(const T& container);

template <typename T>
void resize_list(T& list, uint32_t size);

template <typename T>
void clear_set(T& set);

template <typename S, typename T>
void set_insert(S& set, const T& item);

template <typename T>
void clear_map(T& map);

template <typename M, typename K, typename T>
T& mapped_at(M& map, const K& key);
```

Note that unlike the traits which need to be specialized in the `bond`
namespace, these function can be overloaded in the namespace of the container
type.

The final part of the container concept are enumerators:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class enumerator
{
    explicit enumerator(T& container);
    bool more() const;
    typename element_type<T>::type& next();
};

template <typename T>
class const_enumerator
{
    explicit const_enumerator(const T& container);
    bool more() const;
    const typename element_type<T>::type& next();
};
```

The `const_enumerator` must be implemented for any custom container while the
`enumerator` is used only for lists. As the name indicates, the enumerators
abstract iteration over elements of the container. The default implementation
of `const_enumerator` illustrates well the simple semantics of the interface
[^enumerator]:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class const_enumerator
{
public:
    explicit const_enumerator(const T& container)
        : it(container.begin()),
            end(container.end())
    {}

    bool more() const
    {
        return it != end;
    }

    typename T::const_reference
    next()
    {
        return *(it++);
    }

private:
    typename T::const_iterator it, end;
};
```

- `examples/cpp/core/container_of_pointers`
- `examples/cpp/core/multiprecision`
- `examples/cpp/core/static_array`

[^enumerator]: The default implementation assumes broadly used STL conventions
and may work for many container implementations from libraries such as Boost.
For such containers is not necessary to specialize the enumerators.

String concept
--------------

The custom string concept defined in `bond/core/container_interface.h` serves
as an interface between a custom string type and Bond.

Custom string types are identified by specializing the appropriate trait:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct
is_string
    : std::false_type {};

template <typename T> struct
is_wstring
    : std::false_type {};
```

For example the following specialization would allow Bond to treat
`boost::string_ref` as a string type:

```cpp
template <> struct
is_string<boost::string_ref>
    : std::true_type {};
```

The operations on custom strings are exposed by overloading the following free
functions:

```cpp
template<typename C, typename T>
const C* string_data(const T& str);

template<typename C, typename T>
C* string_data(T& str);

template<typename T>
uint32_t string_length(const T& str);

template<typename T>
void resize_string(T& str, uint32_t size);
```

- `examples/cpp/core/string_ref`

Scalar concept
--------------

The custom scalar type concept defined in `bond/core/scalar_interface.h` serves
as an interface between Bond and a custom type aliasing a built-in scalar type.

The `aliased_type` trait is used to specify which built-in type is being
aliased:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct
aliased_type
{
    typedef void type;
};
```

For example the following specialization would tell Bond to treat
`boost::posix_time::ptime` as if it were an alias of `int64`.

```cpp
template <> struct
aliased_type<boost::posix_time::ptime>
{
    typedef int64_t type;
};
```

Conversions to/from a custom type and its aliased type are implemented as
a pair of free function:

```cpp
template <typename T>
void set_aliased_value(T& var, typename aliased_type<T>::type value);

template <typename T>
typename aliased_type<T>::type get_aliased_value(const T& value);
```

- `examples/cpp/core/time_alias`

Custom allocators
=================

The Bond compiler flag `--allocator` can be used to generate schema structs
such that all containers are declared to use a custom allocator type:

```
gbc c++ --allocator=my::arena example.bond
```

If the allocator is stateful, the application can pass a const reference to an
allocator instance to the struct constructor. The allocator will then be passed
to constructors of all container fields and nested structs. During
deserialization Bond will also make sure that any container elements are
constructed using the same allocator.

The generated structs can use any allocator which implements the C++ Standard
Library allocator concept.

Additionally `--alloc-ctors` flag can be passed in order to generate additional
copy and move constructors for the struct that would accept an allocator argument.
In order to simplify the allocator instance propagation to string and container
fields, `--scoped-alloc` flag will take advantage of [`std::scoped_allocator_adaptor`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/scoped_allocator_adaptor).

Bond APIs which allocate memory also allow use of custom allocators. In
particular `bond::OutputMemoryStream`, which can be used as output stream for
Bond serialization, can allocate the memory blobs for serialized payload with
a user specified allocator.

```cpp
typedef bond::OutputMemoryStream<my::arena> Output;

my::arena arena;
Output output(arena);
bond::CompactBinaryWriter<Output> writer(output);
```

See example `examples/cpp/core/output_stream_allocator`.

Custom streams
==============

Applications can define custom buffers used for writing/reading data during
[de/serialization](#serialization).

An input stream class implements the following input stream concept [^concept]:

```cpp
class InputStream
{
public:
    // Read overload(s) for arithmetic types
    template <typename T>
    void Read(T& value);

    // Read into a memory buffer
    void Read(void *buffer, uint32_t size);

    // Read into a memory blob
    void Read(bond::blob& blob, uint32_t size);
};
```

An output stream class implements the following output stream concept:

```cpp
class OutputStream
{
public:
    // Write overload(s) for arithmetic types
    template<typename T>
    void Write(const T& value);

    // Write a memory buffer
    void Write(const void* value, uint32_t size);

    // Write a memory blob
    void Write(const bond::blob& blob);
};
```

[^concept]: Note that input/output streams are not _interface classes_ which
can be derived from. They are conceptual interfaces, a set of method signatures
that need to be implemented. Furthermore, the Read and Write templates don't
have to be implemented as a single method template (or, for that matter, as
a template at all). They merely mean that a Read/Write method overload must be
defined for every arithmetic type in Bond meta-schema.

Scoped enumerations
===================

Bond provides a standard-compliant solution for scoped enumerations in C++ that
overcomes the limitations of normal C++ enumeration types. Usually enumerations
are part of a schema used with library Bond APIs. However applications can use
the following technique to defined standalone enum types.

Define your enumerations in a .bond file. You can use the same identifiers for
constants in different enumerations in the same namespace scope.

```
namespace example

enum Fruit
{
    Orange = 1,
    Apple = 2
}

enum Color
{
    Green = 1,
    Orange = 7
}
```

Use the `--enum-header` gbc compiler option to generate a standalone
_filename_`_enum.h` header file that you can include for scoped enumerations.

```cpp
#include "enumerations_enum.h"

int main()
{
    example::Fruit fruit;
    example::Color color;

    fruit = example::Fruit::Orange;
    fruit = example::Apple;

    color = example::Green;
    color = example::Color::Orange;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses the Bond compiler to generate the code that you use but your
code does not take a dependency on the Bond library.

See example: `examples/cpp/core/enumerations`.

Exceptions
==========

Bond uses C++ exceptions to communicate errors. All exceptions derive from
`std::exception` and implement the `what()` method which returns a human
readable description of the error. The following exceptions can be thrown
during calls to Bond APIs:

`bond::Exception`
-----------------

Bond-specific errors are reported using exceptions derived from
`bond::Exception` which itself derives from `std::exception`. The following
exception types are defined:

- `bond::CoreException`

    Used to indicate errors such as a missing required field during
    deserialization or an invalid protocol during unmarshaling.

- `bond::StreamException`

    Used to indicate errors related to reading from or writing to a data
    stream, for example attempting to read past the end of data stream.

`std::bad_alloc`
----------------

Failure to allocate memory. For example, this exception can be thrown if the
payload being deserialized contains a container with more elements than can be
fit into available memory.

`std::length_error`
-------------------

The standard library throws this exception to report errors that are
consequence of attempt to exceed implementation-defined lengths for objects
such as `std::string` or `std::vector`.

`std::range_error`
------------------

The standard library `std::wstring_convert::from_bytes` and
`std::wstring_convert::to_bytes` which are used by Bond JSON de/serializer
throw this exception to indicate an invalid string encoding.

Integrating Bond into your build
================================

To consume Bond, you will need to integrate it into your build somehow. If
you are using one of these C++ package managers, Bond is available as a
package that you can consume:

* [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)'s `bond` package

What follows are build-system agnostic instructions for consuming C++ Bond.

These instructions assume that you have used
[Bond's CMake-based build](https://github.com/microsoft/bond/README.md) to
compile and *install* (`make install`/`cmake --build . --target INSTALL`)
Bond into your development environment somewhere. The CMake variable
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` can be used to control where the install target
places the output files.

(The Bond CMake files can't currently be consumed by another CMake project
via `add_directory`.
[Contributions encouraged](https://github.com/microsoft/bond/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to help improve this situation.)

After you've built and installed Bond, you can use whatever build system you
need by

1. teaching it how to automatically run code generation on .bond files;
1. configuring your C++ compiler's `#include` search path to point at Boost
   and Bond; and
1. configuring your linker's library path to have the Boost and Bond
   libraries on its search path.

Step #1 is very build system dependent. Contributions of these build systems
rules to the Bond repository will be happily accepted.

When building the library/executable that is going to use Bond, you'll need
to set your compiler's `#include` search path to point to:

* where your version of Boost is installed
* where your version of Bond is installed

If you use any types from bond.bond (e.g., by using an `import` statement in
your .bond file or by using the C++ `RuntimeSchema` APIs), you will also
need to link the library/executable with Bond (The names may vary depending
on platform/toolset.):

* `libbond.a`/`bond.lib` and
* optionally, `libbond_apply.a`/`bond_apply.lib`, if you plan to `#include
  <bond/core/bond_apply.h>`.

See also the [Optimizing build time](#optimizing-build-time) section,
particularly its discussion of `BOND_LIB_TYPE`.

Optimizing build time
=====================

Extensive use of C++ templates in Bond may sometimes lead to long compilation
times. In order to optimize build speed for projects using Bond, it is
important to understand how the Bond implementation in particular, and C++
templates in general, affect compilation and linking time.

At the high level, the cost of compiling template heavy C++ code comes from
template instantiation. In Bond the most expensive templates to instantiate are
related to deserialization. Deserialization APIs are usually instantiated for
all enabled [protocols](#protocols). This leads to the first obvious way to
optimize build speed: enable only the protocols that are needed.

The following built-in protocols are enabled by default:

- Compact Binary
- Fast Binary
- Simple Binary

Two sets of macros control which built-in protocol are enabled.

- Enable a specific protocol and disable all others

    - `BOND_COMPACT_BINARY_PROTOCOL`
    - `BOND_SIMPLE_BINARY_PROTOCOL`
    - `BOND_FAST_BINARY_PROTOCOL`
    - `BOND_SIMPLE_JSON_PROTOCOL`

It is critical that these macros are always defined the same way for all
compilation units that will be linked into a particular executable. Failure to
do so may lead to violation of the C++ One Definition rule [^one_definition].
To avoid this problem the recommended way to set these macros is via the C++
compiler command line flags in the makefile, e.g.:

```
/DBOND_COMPACT_BINARY_PROTOCOL /DBOND_SIMPLE_BINARY_PROTOCOL
```

C++ templates are instantiated separately in every compilation unit. This means
that building an application which has calls to Bond APIs deserializing a
particular schema in multiple .cpp files will result in repeated instantiation
of the same templates, unnecessarily increasing build time. In order to
mitigate this problem, the Bond compiler generates two additional files for
each schema file: _filename_`_apply.h` and _filename_`_apply.cpp`. Using these
files is optional but for most non-trivial applications it will result in
significant improvement of build time. The `_apply.cpp` can be built as part of
the application project itself, but often it is better to compile it into a
separate static library. This way the static library needs to be rebuilt only
when the schemas change, and otherwise applications can be quickly built and
linked with the schema library. The _filename_`_apply.h` can be thought of as a
header file for the schema library; it must be included in every compilation
unit where Bond APIs are called for any schema defined in _filename_`.bond`.

The Bond compiler command line switch `--apply` can be use to control which
protocols are included in the generated `_apply` files. This can be used to
reduce compilation time for `_apply.cpp`.

```
gbc c++ --apply=fast example.bond
```

Compiling generated _filename_`_apply.cpp` results in instantiation of all the
templates used by the most common APIs such a Serialize and Deserialize for all
the schemas defined in _filename_`.bond`. For applications with very large
schemas it is often beneficial to spread the schema definitions across multiple
`.bond` files. This allows building in parallel multiple, smaller `_apply.cpp`
files rather that one large file.

C++ templates for Bond internal schemas, such as those used to serialize
runtime schema, are pre-instantiated and included in Bond static libraries. It
is recommended that applications include the header file
`bond/core/bond_apply.h` and link to the `bond_apply` static library in order
to reuse the pre-instantiated code. The one exception are applications using
custom protocols - by definition templates pre-instantiated at the time Bond
library was built can't support custom protocols.

If header-only consumption of the library is not required, then defining the
`BOND_LIB_TYPE` macro to `BOND_LIB_TYPE_STATIC` will pre-compile more common
code into the `bond.lib`/`libbond.a` library and will reduce the number of included headers.

When using the Microsoft Visual Studio toolchain there are two important things
to be aware related to build time. First, always use 64-bit tools. In
particular the 32-bit version of link.exe is not capable of linking large
template-based code. It will either fail, or if you are unlucky, it will run
several orders of magnitude times longer than the 64-bit version. You can force
64-bit tools using environment variables:

For Visual Studio 2012:

```
set _IsNativeEnvironment=true
```

For Visual Studio 2013:

```
set PreferredToolArchitecture=x64
```

Link-time code generation can also lead to egregiously long link times. It is
strongly recommended to disable it for projects using Bond. Link-time code
generation does not improve runtime performance for Bond APIs and in many cases
it actually degrades it. If application code _must_ be built with LTCG enabled,
we recommend using a separate static schema library as described above, and
disabling LTCG when building the library.

See example: `examples/cpp/core/static_library`.

[^one_definition]: Since breaking the C++ One Definition rule may lead to very
unpredictable runtime behaviour, the Bond implementation has a built-in
assertion mechanism to detect it.
